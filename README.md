# Chatbot
This project presents an AI-powered chatbot integrated with a secure user authentication system. The chatbot leverages Google’s Gemini AI to provide dynamic responses based on user-selected roles (General Assistant, Technical Expert, Creative Writer, Medical Professional, or Custom Prompts). Users can register, log in, reset passwords, and verify accounts via OTP (One-Time Password). The system also includes session management, allowing users to revisit past conversations.

Key Features:
✔ Multi-role AI chatbot (Technical, Creative, Medical, customized etc.)


✔ User authentication (Login, Signup, Password Reset,    OTP Verification)
✔ Session history tracking
✔ Custom prompt support
✔ Responsive UI with voice toggle

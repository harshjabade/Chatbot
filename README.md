# Chatbot
This project presents an AI-powered chatbot integrated with a secure user authentication system. The chatbot leverages Googleâ€™s Gemini AI to provide dynamic responses based on user-selected roles (General Assistant, Technical Expert, Creative Writer, Medical Professional, or Custom Prompts). Users can register, log in, reset passwords, and verify accounts via OTP (One-Time Password). The system also includes session management, allowing users to revisit past conversations.
